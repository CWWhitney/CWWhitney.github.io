	abstract = {Rural farmers often manage homegardens, as the main source of food for their families. However, the contribution of this agrobiodiversity to food and nutrition security has rarely been explored empirically. The present study sought to assess the influence of homegarden agrobiodiversity, production system parameters, and socio-economic factors on household dietary diversity and anthropometric conditions in southwest Uganda. Plant inventories of 102 homegardens were followed by two 24-hour recalls (n=589) and anthropometric measurements (n=325) of household members, as well as food insecurity questionnaires (n=95) for households. Regression models explained between 16 and 50\% of variance in dietary diversity and between 21 and 75\% in anthropometric measurements. Results indicate that supporting diverse homegarden systems can be part of the solution to food insecurity in Uganda. Recommendations are made for further strengthening the role of homegardens towards improving dietary and anthropometric outcomes.},
