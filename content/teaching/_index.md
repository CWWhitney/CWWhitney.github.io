### Pedagogical Foundation

My approach to teaching is deeply informed by years of experiential education, including time as a mate and captain on sail training vessels. This background instilled a core belief that the most profound learning happens through hands-on, collaborative problem-solving in dynamic environments. I strive to bring this same spirit of resilience, clear communication, and shared discovery into the academic classroom and research supervision.
