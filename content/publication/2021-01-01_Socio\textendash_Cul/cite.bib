  abstract = {Socio\textendash Cultural Significance of Yerba Mat\'e among Syrian Residents and Diaspora. Syria is the world's second\textendash largest importer of the dried leaves of Ilex paraguariensis A.St.\textendash Hil., commonly known as yerba mat\'e. The unique story of yerba mat\'e in the Syrian beverage culture started at the beginning of the twentieth century when Syrian migrants returning from South America brought the beverage with them. The overall aim of our study is to understand yerba mat\'e use among Syrians and its role as an essential part of the Syrian beverage culture. We compare yerba mat\'e consumption on spatial, gender, and religious bases through semi\textendash structured interviews with 50 respondents, with equal participation among genders, place of residence, and cultural\textendash religious groups (Sunni, Alawite, Christian, Druze, and Ismaili). We found that the Alawite and Druze groups have the highest yerba mat\'e consumption, and that men drink more than women. Yerba mat\'e was the most preferred stimulant drink among participants, followed by coffee and tea, respectively. Interviews reveal social and cultural factors, perceived addiction, perceived pleasure, and perceived health properties as the drivers behind yerba mat\'e consumption in Syria.},
