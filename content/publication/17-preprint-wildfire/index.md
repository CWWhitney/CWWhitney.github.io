abstract: Decision-makers often wish to have a quantitative basis for their decisions.
  However, there is often no 'hard data' for many important variables, which can paralyze
  decision-making processes or lead decision-makers to conclude that large research
  efforts are needed before a decision can be made. That is, many variables decision
  makers must consider cannot be precisely quantified, at least not without unreasonable
  effort. The major objective of (prescriptive) decision analysis is to support decision-making
  processes faced with this problem. The decisionSupport() function in the R package
  decisionSupport can be applied to conduct decision analysis. We provide a simple
  example (in annotated R code) of how the decisionSupport package can be used to
  inform a decision process. The example provided simulates the decision of forest
  managers to use controlled fires in conifer forests vs. running the risk of severe
  fire.
