  abstract = {CONTEXT: Late spring frosts are a major problem for apple production in Germany. Frost events frequently lead to yield losses and quality reduction. This has motivated the development of several frost protection measures, which differ in terms of effectiveness, costs and workload. In many cases, it is an open question for fruit growers if investing in frost protection is worthwhile and which strategy would most positively affect their bottom line. OBJECTIVE: To support decision-making, we applied a participatory process with frost protection experts to build a probabilistic model.},
